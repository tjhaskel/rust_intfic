rust_intfic is a framework for writing interactive fiction games
-y It supports cool stuff like "quotes" and typed, colored text!
Most importantly, it lets you focus on writing a branching story with minimal code!

  Isn't that neat?
*- Yeah I guess. -> yes, yup, y, sure -> neat
*- Not really. -> no, nope, n, nah -> not_neat

:- neat

I thought you would think so
-> flag_example

:- not_neat
Aw, I thought it was...
-> flag_example

:- flag_example

Moving on. You can set flags like so:
?- flag_set => this should never be seen
=- flag_set = true
-> check_flag

:- check_flag

And you can retrieve flags like this!
?- flag_set => -g This is shown because the flag was true!
